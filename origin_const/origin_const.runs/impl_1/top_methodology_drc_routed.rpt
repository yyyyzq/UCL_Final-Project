LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell control_inst/communication_inst/led_rst_OBUF_inst_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) system_inst/transmitter_inst/rng_inst/one_gen.bin_reg[0]/CLR,

 (the first 15 of 241 listed). The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#2 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell reset_sync_inst/rst_sync_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) reset_sync_inst/rst_reg/PRE, reset_sync_inst/rst_sync_reg/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-6#1 Warning
Timing of a RAM block might be sub-optimal  
The timing for the instance c1_reg[0]_i_1, implemented as a RAM block, might be sub-optimal as no output register was merged into the block.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-6#2 Warning
Timing of a RAM block might be sub-optimal  
The timing for the instance c1_reg[0]_i_1__0, implemented as a RAM block, might be sub-optimal as no output register was merged into the block.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-6#3 Warning
Timing of a RAM block might be sub-optimal  
The timing for the instance sel_0, implemented as a RAM block, might be sub-optimal as no output register was merged into the block.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-6#4 Warning
Timing of a RAM block might be sub-optimal  
The timing for the instance sel_0__0, implemented as a RAM block, might be sub-optimal as no output register was merged into the block.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-6#5 Warning
Timing of a RAM block might be sub-optimal  
The timing for the instance sel_0__1, implemented as a RAM block, might be sub-optimal as no output register was merged into the block.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-6#6 Warning
Timing of a RAM block might be sub-optimal  
The timing for the instance sel_0__2, implemented as a RAM block, might be sub-optimal as no output register was merged into the block.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-6#7 Warning
Timing of a RAM block might be sub-optimal  
The timing for the instance system_inst/receiver_inst/constellation_recorder/ram_reg, implemented as a RAM block, might be sub-optimal as no output register was merged into the block.
Related violations: <none>
